294
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,527
好家伙 这可真是个难题啊
Boy, that's a toughie.

295
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:57,130
你们还有联系?
You still see her?

296
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:59,132
呃 不是那种联系
Well, no, not socially.

297
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,366
但 你要知道 工作的时候会见到嘛
But, you know, just at work.

298
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:02,869
你和她一起工作?!
You work with her?!

299
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:04,437
为什么不告诉我?!
How could you not tell me that?!

300
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:06,973
在车里的时候我想告诉你来着 但你叫我闭嘴!
I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking!

301
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,608
哦 好吧 所以这都是我的错咯?
Oh, okay. So you're saying this is my fault?

302
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:10,110
不 当然不是了
No, of course not.

303
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:11,745
好吧 听着
Okay, look,

304
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,146
与其接着吵架
instead of fighting,

305
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:15,715
我们还不如把灯关了
why don't we dim the lights,

306
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,618
嗯 把衣服脱了然后一起造个人?
um, get naked and make a baby?

307
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:28,994
我只不过是想缓和下气氛
I was trying to lighten the mood.

308
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:32,330
很不容易的 你试试就知道了
It's not easy. You try it.

309
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,667
你好 母亲
Hello, Mother.

310
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:36,935
Shelly! 我的宝贝最近如何啊?
Shelly! How's my baby doing?

311
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:38,403
我只想让你知道
I just wanted to let you know

312
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:41,406
Amy可以从你的夜晚祷告名单里面除去了
that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers.

313
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:43,208
除非你愿意帮我祈祷
Unless you're open to praying for

314
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,510
一个蜂窝会扣在她头上
a beehive to fall on her head.

315
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:47,712
哦 怎么了?
Oh, what's going on?

316
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,013
她和我分手了
She broke up with me.

317
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:50,481
哦 Shelly
Oh, Shelly.

318
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:51,282
不 我会没事的
No, I'll be okay.

319
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:53,217
不过 我觉得我可以
But I think that I'd like

320
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:55,953
把戒指寄回给您了
to send the ring back to you.

321
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,121
不要太着急
Well, let's not be hasty.

322
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,923
你确定一切都结束了吗?
Are you sure it's over for good?

323
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:01,125
我是结束了 我受够女人了
It's over for me. I'm done with women.

324
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,061
就像我发誓不吃跳跳糖一样
Like when I swore off Pop Rocks.

325
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:06,330
他们都是故意伤人的
They both hurt you on purpose.

326
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,399
可以告诉我事情的经过吗?
You want to tell me what happened?

327
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,701
你会说一切都是冥冥之中天注定的吗?
Are you going to say it's all part of God's plan?

328
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,601
很有可能
Good chance.

329
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,804
那算了 谢谢
Then no, thank you.

330
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,605
宝贝啊 先别寄回来
Well, honey, don't send it back yet.

331
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:17,833
你姐姐已经结婚了 我不想让你哥
Your sister's married, and I'm not letting your brother

332
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,511
把祖传戒指交给他正在交往的贱人
give my grandmother's ring to that whore he's dating.

333
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:25,348
抹大拉的马利亚（被耶稣拯救的妓女）不也名誉不佳吗?
Wasn't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?

334
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,051
等哪天你那不开窍的哥哥拯救了人类
When your idiot brother redeems mankind,

335
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,221
他想和谁交往都行
he can date whoever he wants.

336
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,726
我知道你现在很伤心 但会好起来的
I know it hurts now, but it's gonna get better.

337
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:36,726
没错
Yeah.

338
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,094
一切都会好转的
Everything's gonna be okay.

339
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,996
你身上优点多得是
You've got so much to offer.

340
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:42,264
谢谢你
Thank you.

341
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,600
与你相伴是任何男人的福分
Any man would be lucky to have you.

342
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,202
一点没错
That's true.

343
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,570
我只是希望我做对了事情
I just hope I did the right thing.

344
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,972
