345
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,142
或许这就是问题所在... 你一直在做对的事情
Maybe that's the problem... you always do the right thing.

346
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,612
或许是时候错一错了
Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing.

347
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:06,420
就像你现在这样?
Like you're doing right now?

348
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,925
是的
Exactly.

349
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,631
我一遍又一遍地问你愿不愿意
I asked you over and over if you were okay.

350
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,938
你既然不愿意 又何必要参加婚礼?
Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't?

351
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,036
我本来觉得自己愿意 但结果并非如此
I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.

352
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:24,773
好吧 听着 我可能没做到百分百的真诚
Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful,

353
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,308
但是你 抬你真的不容易啊!
but you, you are not easy to lift!

354
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:33,147
哇哦!
Wow!

355
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,182
结了婚就是不一样
Well, marriage must agree with you.

356
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,352
你简直红光焕发啊
Well, you are just glowing.

357
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,691
我才没红光焕发
I'm not glowing.

358
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,293
我生着气呢
I'm upset.

359
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,462
不管是什么 你看起来很不错
Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.

360
00:15:57,438 --> 00:16:00,274
咚咚咚 Penny?
Knock, knock, knock, Penny?

361
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:03,576
咚咚咚 Penny? 咚咚咚 Penny?
Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?

362
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,014
这是干什么?
What's this?

363
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,282
Leonard把事情告诉我了
Leonard told me what happened,

364
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:11,151
所以我就自发给你做了点热饮
so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.

365
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,820
你真贴心啊
Oh. That's so sweet of you.

366
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,421
是啊 我知道
Yeah. I know.

367
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:16,889
不过 在这世道
Turns out, being sweet

368
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:19,425
单单贴心可留不住女孩
isn't enough to keep a girl these days.

369
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,493
{\an8}暗指麦当娜的歌曲拜金女孩material girl

370
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,493
我觉得要怪麦当娜
I blame Madonna.

371
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:24,496
你和Amy分手的事真是可惜
I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.

372
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:25,965
关于Leonard 也是可惜
Well, I'm sorry about Leonard.

373
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,513
我以为自己已经把他调教好了
Thought I raised him better than that.

374
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,636
本来这事就够糟糕了
You know, it's bad enough what happened,

375
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:33,239
他还试图隐瞒他每天
but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her

376
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:35,174
都在学校里看见她的事实
all the time at the university.

377
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:37,576
每天都见? 是谁啊?
He does? Who is it?

378
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:39,911
一个叫Mandy的女孩
Some girl named Mandy.

379
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,081
- Mandy Chao?  - 就这货
- Mandy Chao?  - Yeah.

380
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,817
你没必要担心人家啦
Oh, you don't need to worry about her.

381
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,017
她智慧和美丽兼具
She's brilliant and attractive.

382
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,520
她才看不上Leonard呢
She can do way better than Leonard.

383
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,560
真好啊
That's great.

384
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,262
等一等
Wait a minute.

385
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,264
我知道这听起来有点不靠谱
I know this may sound farfetched,

386
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,999
但我现在单身待售呢
but I'm on the market now.

387
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,800
我要是跟Mandy约会
You know, if I dated Mandy,

388
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,770
算是同时给Leonard和Amy一个教训
that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.

389
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:07,339
太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

390
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,540
嗯 你说得对 我不能跟一个自尊心低到
Oh, you're right. I could never be with a woman

391
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,344
跟Leonard约会的人在一起
whose self-esteem was so low she'd be with Leonard.

392
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,080
我跟Leonard在一起呢
I'm with Leonard.

393
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:17,548
嗯 我知道 回不了头了
Yeah, I know. Forever.

394
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:22,587
真想不到会走到今天这一步？
Who would have believed these things would happen to us?

395
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:24,122
对吧？
Right?

396
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,125
不敢相信Amy真的说到做到了
I can't believe Amy actually went through with it.

397
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,460
等下
Hang on.

398
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,096
你早就知道她要跟我分手？
You knew that she was going to end it with me?

399
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:33,864
你有试着阻止她吗？
Did you try and stop her?

400
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:38,102
我告诉她听从自己的想法做让她开心的事
I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.

401
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,336
做让她开心的事？
Do what makes her happy?

402
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,906
她会弹竖琴 而且车付了全款
She plays the harp and her car is paid for.

403
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,041
她还想要多快乐？
How much happier can she be?

404
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:46,643
好吧 听着 她觉得你是个糟糕的男友
Okay, look, it's not my fault

405
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,313
不是我的错
that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.
