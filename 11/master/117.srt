406
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,216
我懂了
I see.

407
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,285
好吧...
Well...

408
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,056
我要走了
I think I'll be going.

409
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,725
- Sheldon...  - 别说话
- Sheldon...  - No, no, no, no.

410
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:05,128
我们谈完了
We are done here.

411
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,333
你能不能打开门
Would you mind opening the door

412
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:13,569
然后非常生气地在我背后关上？
and then angrily slamming it behind me?

413
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:16,005
当然
Sure.

414
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:17,974
谢谢
Thank you.

415
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,675
注意摔狠点
And slam it hard,

416
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:21,444
因为我非常生气
because I am pretty steamed.

417
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,815
好吧 Leonard 别伤心
All right, Leonard, hang in there.

418
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:28,083
明天见
Talk to you tomorrow.

419
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,787
怎么了？ 他们才刚结婚
What happened? They just got married.

420
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:33,255
我不知道
I don't know.

421
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:36,625
乱七八糟的 他们在维加斯大吵了一架
It's a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.

422
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:37,860
你觉得他们会分手吗？
Think they'll break up?

423
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:40,128
不晓得 听着挺糟糕的
I don't know. Sounds pretty bad.

424
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,931
Penny一个人搬回她公寓了
Penny's back in her apartment all by herself.

425
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,367
是咩？
Really?

426
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,268
你想不想再听一个
Would you like to hear another reason

427
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:00,203
男人比女人好的原因？
why men are better than women?

428
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,506
当然 凑齐一百个吧
Sure, let's make it an even hundred.

429
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:07,176
你绝对不会吻我 然后让我说"我爱你"
You would never kiss me and make me say "I love you"

430
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,845
然后跟我分手
and then break up with me.

431
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:11,780
我确实不会
I wouldn't.

432
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,250
你知道为什么吗？
And you know why?

433
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,784
因为你是个男人
'Cause you're a man.

434
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:19,288
性别里的香槟酒
The champagne of genders.

435
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:21,457
我虽然是个男人
Well, I may be a man,

436
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:24,360
但我觉得这次是我把事情搞砸了
but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one.

437
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:27,996
好吧 但你承认了 像个男人一样
Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man.

438
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,464
女人们就只会说
All you hear women say is,

439
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:32,133
"我点个沙拉就好" 对不?
"I'll just have a salad." You know?

440
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,935
"我的润唇膏呢？"
"Where's my lip gloss?"

441
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:36,671
"我觉得这个元素应该叫镭"
"I think this element should be called radium."

442
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:41,109
最后一个是居里夫人
That last one was Madame Curie.

443
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,811
我猜出来了
I figured that out.

444
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:46,247
你知道吗？ 她算是名义上的男人
You know what? She was kind of an honorary man.

445
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:49,684
科学给了她男人的家伙
She had a penis made of science.

446
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:56,591
真不敢相信我新婚夜是跟你过的
Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.

447
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:57,992
是吗？
Really?

448
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,227
这一直是我预料的结果
I never imagined it any other way.

420
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:33,255
我不知道
I don't know.

421
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:36,625
